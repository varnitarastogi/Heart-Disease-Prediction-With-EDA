# Heart-Failure-Prediction-With-EDA
Heart failure is a common event caused by cardiovascular diseases. The dataset used contains 12 attributes, one of them being the occurence or nonoccurence of a heart disease.The data has been taken from Kaggle. The project aims to predict whether a person will have a heart disease based on the attributes. The final model with the best performance for this supervised learning task is XGBOOST with a precision score of 87%. Hyperparameter tuning has been done with the help of OPTUNA.
